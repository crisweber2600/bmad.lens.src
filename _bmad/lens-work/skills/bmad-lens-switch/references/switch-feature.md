# Switch Feature

Switch the active feature context to a different feature and load appropriate cross-feature context.

## When to Use

- When the user says "switch to feature X", "work on X", "context switch to X", or similar
- When starting work on a different feature in the same session
- When an agent needs to load context for a feature other than the current one

## Resolution Order

1. Validate `--feature-id` exists in `feature-index.yaml`
2. Read full state from `feature.yaml`
3. Compute cross-feature context to load based on dependency types
4. Return feature state and context paths; set active feature in session

If the feature is not found in `feature-index.yaml`, return an error immediately — do not fall through to filesystem search.

## Process

Run the switch operation:

```bash
python3 ./scripts/switch-ops.py switch \
  --governance-repo {governance_repo} \
  --feature-id {target_feature_id}
```

## Output

```json
{
  "status": "pass",
  "feature": {
    "id": "auth-login",
    "name": "User Authentication",
    "domain": "platform",
    "service": "identity",
    "phase": "dev",
    "track": "quickplan",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "active",
    "owner": "cweber",
    "stale": false,
    "updated": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "context_to_load": {
    "summaries": ["features/platform/identity/user-profile/summary.md"],
    "full_docs": ["features/platform/auth/oauth-provider/tech-plan.md"]
  }
}
```

`stale: true` is set when `updated` is more than 30 days old. `context_to_load.summaries` contains paths for `related` dependencies. `context_to_load.full_docs` contains paths for `depends_on` and `blocks` dependencies.

## Stale Context Warning

When `stale: true` is returned, surface a warning inline with the switch confirmation:

```
[auth-login] active. Phase: dev.
⚠ Context may be stale (last updated 45 days ago).
```

Do not block the switch — load context and proceed; only warn.

## Cross-Feature Context Loading

After a successful switch, load the files listed in `context_to_load`:

| Relationship type | Files to load | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `related` | `summary.md` | Lightweight awareness; full docs unnecessary |
| `depends_on` | `tech-plan.md` | Active dependency; need full technical spec |
| `blocks` | `tech-plan.md` | Blocking dependency; need full technical spec |

Load each file using the standard file-read mechanism. Files that don't exist on disk can be skipped with a warning — they may not yet be authored.

## Session State

After a successful switch:
1. Set `session.active_feature_id = feature.id`
2. Store `session.active_feature = feature` (the full feature object from output)
3. Store `session.cross_feature_context = context_to_load` (the paths loaded)

Subsequent skill invocations should read `session.active_feature_id` without calling this script again.

## Errors

| Error | Exit code | Cause |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `Feature '{id}' not found in feature-index.yaml` | 1 | featureId not in index |
| `feature-index.yaml not found at {path}` | 1 | Index file missing from governance repo |
| `feature.yaml not found for '{id}'` | 1 | Index entry exists but feature.yaml is absent |
| `Invalid feature-id: ...` | 1 | featureId contains invalid characters or path traversal |
| `Failed to parse feature-index.yaml: ...` | 1 | YAML parse error in index |
