# LENS Workbench Module — v3.1.0

**Module Code:** `lens-work`
**Type:** Standalone BMAD Module
**Schema Version:** 3.1

## Overview

LENS Workbench v3 provides guided lifecycle routing with git-orchestrated discipline for BMAD workflows. It manages the full planning lifecycle from pre-planning through sprint execution using automated branch topology, PR-based review gates, and constitutional governance.

## Design Principles

- **Git is the only source of truth** — no secondary state stores, no git-ignored runtime state
- **PRs are the only gating mechanism** — automatic PR creation at phase/milestone promotion boundaries
- **Authority domains are explicit** — every file belongs to exactly one domain
- **Sensing is automatic** — cross-initiative awareness at lifecycle gates
- **Declarative only** — no runtime code (JS, Python, etc.)

## Skills (5)

Skills fall into two archetypes:

- **Internal delegation skills** (`git-state`, `git-orchestration`, `constitution`, `sensing`, `checklist`) — invoked by workflows for specific operations. Not directly user-facing.
- **Workflow skills** (`dashboard`) — thin SKILL.md wrappers that redirect to a workflow. These appear as Copilot skills but execute a full workflow.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `git-state` | Derive initiative state from git primitives (read-only) |
| `git-orchestration` | Branch creation, commits, pushes, PR management, provider adapter (write) |
| `constitution` | Constitutional governance resolution and compliance |
| `sensing` | Cross-initiative overlap detection at lifecycle gates |
| `checklist` | Phase gate checklists with progressive validation |

## Scripts

PR creation and authentication use cross-platform scripts with REST API + PAT. **No `gh` CLI required.**

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `promote-branch.ps1/.sh` | Branch promotion + PR creation via GitHub REST API |
| `store-github-pat.ps1/.sh` | Secure PAT setup into environment variables (run outside AI chat) |

PAT resolution: `GITHUB_PAT` env var → `GH_TOKEN` env var → `profile.yaml` → URL-only fallback

## Installation

### Quick Install (default — GitHub Copilot adapter only)

```bash
# From the control repo root:
./_bmad/lens-work/scripts/install.sh

# Windows:
powershell .\_bmad\lens-work\scripts\install.ps1
```

### Multi-IDE Install

```bash
./_bmad/lens-work/scripts/install.sh --all-ides
```

### Update Existing Adapters

```bash
./_bmad/lens-work/scripts/install.sh --update
```

See `module.yaml` `install_questions` for configuration options (target projects path, default git provider, IDE selection).

## Quick Start

1. **Install** — run the installer script above
2. **Onboard** — use `/onboard` to bootstrap the control repo (detect provider, validate auth, create profile, auto-clone missing TargetProjects from inventory)
3. **Create initiative** — use `/new-domain`, `/new-service`, or `/new-feature`
4. **Begin planning** — use `/preplan` to start the lifecycle
5. **Check status** — use `/status` at any time to see git-derived state

## Components

### Agent

- `LENS` — lifecycle router and control-plane orchestrator
- Runtime source: `agents/lens.agent.md`
- Structured companion for validation and tooling: `agents/lens.agent.yaml`

### Workflow Sets

- **Core:** `phase-lifecycle`, `milestone-promotion`
- **Router:** `init-initiative`, `preplan`, `businessplan`, `techplan`, `devproposal`, `sprintplan`, `dev`, `discover`
- **Utility:** `onboard`, `status`, `next`, `switch`, `help`, `module-management`
- **Governance:** `compliance-check`, `resolve-constitution`, `cross-initiative`


## Commands

All commands are available via the LENS agent menu. Initiative creation is now consolidated under a single `[NI] Create Initiative` entry (domain, service, or feature). New commands:
- `[CL] Close Initiative` — formally complete, abandon, or supersede the current initiative
- `[UG] Lens Upgrade` — migrate control repo to latest schema version

Menu/command triggers:
`/onboard`, `/create-initiative` (`/new-domain`, `/new-service`, `/new-feature`), `/preplan`, `/businessplan`, `/techplan`, `/devproposal`, `/sprintplan`, `/dev`, `/status`, `/next`, `/switch`, `/promote`, `/sense`, `/constitution`, `/discover`, `/module-management`, `/help`, `/close`, `/lens-upgrade`

## Configuration

Configuration is carried in `bmadconfig.yaml`.

- In source, `bmadconfig.yaml` acts as the template for BMAD agent activation and module defaults.
- In installed control repos, `bmadconfig.yaml` is the runtime materialized config file.

Install-time values are sourced from `module.yaml` install questions:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `target-projects-path` | Where repos are cloned | `../TargetProjects` |
| `default-git-remote` | Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps) | `github` |
| `ides` | IDE adapters to install | `github-copilot` |

The install-question keys use validator-friendly kebab-case. During installation, the module installer maps them into the existing runtime `bmadconfig.yaml` keys `target_projects_path` and `default_git_remote` so agent and workflow compatibility stays intact.

## Dependencies

- **Required:** `core` — BMAD core infrastructure (party-mode workflow, shared tasks, base agent definitions)
- **Optional:** `cis` — Creative Innovation Suite (brainstorming, design thinking, storytelling skills used during preplan/expressplan), `tea` — Test Engineering Academy (test framework setup, test design, test automation skills used during devproposal/sprintplan)

## Known Issues & Next Steps

- Token efficiency: Some workflow prompts and instructions could be compressed for lower token usage.
- Menu categorization: Opportunity to group menu items by lifecycle phase for clarity.
- First-run detection: Logic could be refined for more robust onboarding.
- Sensing workflow: Prompt and step consolidation for efficiency.
- Workflow validation: Deep validation and migration to step-driven execution is planned (see TODO.md).
- Dual agent representation: `.md` runtime source and `.yaml` structured companion pattern to be documented.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the full checklist and next steps.
