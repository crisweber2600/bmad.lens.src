## v2.0 → v2.x — Foundation & Hardening (Mar 9–23, 2026)

The initial v2.0 release established the core contract-driven architecture. The rapid v2.x hardening period (70+ commits over 2 weeks) stabilized all user-facing workflows and added critical missing capabilities.

### v2.0 Baseline Capabilities

- **Lifecycle contract** (`lifecycle.yaml` schema v2) — declarative phases, audiences, tracks
- **5 skills** — git-state, git-orchestration, constitution, sensing, checklist
- **7 router workflows** — init-initiative, preplan, businessplan, techplan, devproposal, sprintplan, dev
- **6 utility workflows** — onboard, status, next, switch, help, module-management
- **3 governance workflows** — compliance-check, cross-initiative, resolve-constitution
- **13 prompts** — one per user-facing command
- **5 cross-platform scripts** — install, create-pr, promote-branch, setup-control-repo, store-github-pat
- **4 IDE adapters** — github-copilot, cursor, claude, codex
- **Audience-based promotion** — small → medium → large → base
- **4 tracks** — full, feature, tech-change, hotfix

### New Features Added in v2.x

#### /dev Workflow — Epic-Level Implementation Loop
*Commits: `fa9e54f`, `e978e57`, `45478bd`, `e0ef6d8`, `e752885`, `685c5a5`, `ad6c971`*

The `/dev` command was skeletal in v2.0. The v2.x series fleshed it out into a complete implementation orchestration system:

- Epic-level branching with per-story sub-branches in target repos
- Target repo validation before dev phase begins
- Enforced target-repo-only writes (no control repo modifications during dev)
- PR merge-wait gates — agent stops until story PR is merged before proceeding
- Auto-push and epic PR creation after all stories in an epic are merged
- Story chaining with per-epic stops

#### /discover Workflow — Repository Intelligence
*Commits: `e27ec8a`, `c308a21`, `1debb3d`, `74894d5`, `5501297`, `6dc2aaf`*

New workflow for exploring and documenting target project repositories:

- Fetch and checkout most-recent-commit branches per repo (local + remote)
- Documentation generation routed to `Docs/{domain}/{service}/{repo}/`
- LanguageDetector, ContextGenerator, StateManager enhancements
- DiscoveryReport with prompt and module registration

#### Preflight System
*Commits: `74609e6`, `0753147`, `f67f500`, `9486c23`, `1119c25`*

- Mandatory preflight checks on all commands
- Alpha/beta channels: always-pull rule (git pull before every operation)
- Constitution caching with skip_constitution support for performance
- Shared `workflows/includes/preflight.md` include replacing embedded blocks

#### Adversarial Review Gates
*Commits: `7b99c4a`, `24dcea7`*

- Adversarial-review entry gate enforced after promotion
- Gate blocking on negative review verdict (hard stop, not advisory)

#### Promotion Fixes
*Commits: `fb23e15`, `d915a9c`, `9711827`*

- Target audience branches created from initiative root (not phase branch)
- `large → base` promotion aligned with size-topology convention
- Mandatory phase completion epilogue — PR creation required at phase end

#### Constitution Enforcement
*Commits: `3f4713b`*

- Constitution checks enforced across all lens-work workflows (previously spotty)

#### Script Improvements
*Commits: `1709af5`, `2873047`, `6a668e4`*

- Script-based PR creation and promotion checks added to lens-work
- Enterprise GitHub support with per-repo owner flags in setup scripts
- URL parse fix for dotted repo names on Windows bash

#### Router Workflow Stabilization
*Commits: `716e212`, `dbf8c57`, `f907d7a`, `4328a95`, `57ea8b6`, `def2f08`, `7aa39e3`*

- All router workflows aligned with reference implementation
- BusinessPlan batch flow completed with push+PR and artifact gate
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 routers modernized and validated

#### Other v2.x Changes

- `/next` upgraded from recommendation-only to execute-actions mode (`ba1f914`)
- `/switch` includes remote initiative branches in selection (`9c09f12`)
- Domain/service scopes skip track collection, scaffold TargetProjects folders (`359fe52`)
- Iteration renamed to initiative in branch naming (`55140ce`)
- `state.yaml` references removed — git-derived state only (`8520ae7`)
- BMAD path migration from v6.0.4 to v6.2.0 (`0a8d853`)

---

## v2.x → v3.0 — Milestone Architecture (Mar 31, 2026)

**Breaking change: schema v2 → v3.** This release replaced the audience-based promotion model with a milestone-based architecture. All existing workflows were rewritten.

### Core Architecture Change

| Concept | v2 | v3 |
|---------|----|----|
| **Promotion backbone** | Audiences (small → medium → large → base) | Milestones (techplan → devproposal → sprintplan → dev-ready → dev-complete) |
| **Branch naming** | `{root}-{audience}` | `{root}-{milestone}` |
| **State storage** | Git-derived (branch + PR only) | `initiative-state.yaml` (committed YAML) + git-derived |
| **Phase → scope mapping** | Phases mapped to audiences | Phases mapped to milestones |
| **Version guard** | None | `LENS_VERSION` file with preflight check |

### Schema v3 — Milestone Model
*Commits: `5b99e11`, `27c0d15`*

```yaml
# lifecycle.yaml v3 key changes
schema_version: 3
milestones:
  techplan:
    role: "Technical feasibility"
    phases: [preplan, businessplan, techplan]
  devproposal:
    role: "Implementation readiness"
    phases: [devproposal]
    entry_gate: adversarial-review
  sprintplan:
    role: "Sprint execution plan"
    phases: [sprintplan]
    entry_gate: stakeholder-approval
  dev-ready:
    role: "Execution baseline"
    phases: []
  dev-complete:
    role: "Execution complete"
    phases: []
    optional: true
```

### Initiative State (YAML-First)
*Commits: `a7f5930`, `60777f1`, `e9d8601`*

New committed state file (`initiative-state.yaml`) replaces pure git-derived state:

```yaml
initiative_root: foo-bar-auth
scope: feature
phase: techplan
phase_status: in-progress
milestone: techplan
track: full
artifacts:
  preplan: { status: complete, committed_at: "2026-03-31T..." }
```

Operations added to git-orchestration:
- `create-initiative-state` — scaffold initial state at init
- `update-initiative-state` — atomic updates (phase, milestone, artifacts)

### LENS_VERSION Preflight Guard
*Commit: `6fb56bb`*

- `LENS_VERSION` file written at module install
- Preflight checks version compatibility before every command
- Blocks execution if control repo version is too old for the module

### All Router Workflows Rewritten for Milestones
*Commits: `2745f4a` through `e05cc61` (Stories 2.1–2.7)*

Every router workflow updated from audience-based to milestone-based model:
- Preplan, BusinessPlan, TechPlan, DevProposal, SprintPlan
- git-orchestration updated for milestone branch operations
- SprintPlan now batch-creates all dev-story artifacts per epic

### Governance Publication
*Commits: `b518687`, `06413c1`, `e0ef675`*

- `publish-to-governance` operation added to git-orchestration
- Milestone-promotion workflow publishes artifacts to governance repo
- Sensing reads governance historical context (dual-read bootstrapping)

### /close Workflow
*Commits: `a3707e7`, `acae548`*

New router workflow for ending initiatives:
- Close with `completed`, `abandoned`, or `superseded` status
- Tombstone publication to governance for historical record
- Closed initiatives filtered from live sensing conflict detection (`b1e7de8`)

### Sensing Improvements
*Commits: `2d70f52`, `a3d5821`, `7a85135`*

- Structured sensing report with governance historical context
- Graceful downgrade when governance directory is missing
- `scan-governance-history` returns `available: true` with empty list instead of error

### /lens-upgrade Workflow
*Commits: `9e0cf05`, `31a58b5`*

- `--dry-run` flag for previewing migrations
- YAML schema migration with version detection
- Initiative-state creation for pre-v3 initiatives

### New Prompts
*Commits: `059daf1`, `23d88a0`, `007aaff`*

- `lens-work.close.prompt.md` — `/close` command
- `lens-work.module-management.prompt.md` — `/module-management` command
- `lens-work.compliance-check.prompt.md` — compliance gate trigger

### Documentation Overhaul
*Commits: `d907562`, `401d7cd`, `54ba06b`*

- All docs updated from v2 to v3.0 terminology
- Lifecycle visual guide added with Mermaid diagrams
- Lifecycle improvement roadmap documented

---

## v3.0 → v3.1 — Lifecycle Improvements (Apr 1, 2026)

**Schema change: v3 → v3.1 (backward-compatible).** Ten improvements implemented in a single batch commit. All new features are additive — no breaking changes.

*Commit: `1d18af4`*

### 1. Promote Semantics (Approval-Only)

`/promote` became strictly an approval-verification action. The happy path auto-creates PRs via `auto_advance_promote`; `/promote` confirms the merged PR and transitions the milestone.

### 2. Branch Cleanup (Squash-and-Delete)

Automatic squash-merge and deletion of source milestone branches after promotion. Reduces long-lived branch count from 5 to 2 (root + dev-ready). Initiative root and dev-ready branches are always preserved.

### 3. Hotfix-Express Track

New `hotfix-express` track with informational-only gates. Bypasses constitution gate and adversarial review. Requires explicit `permit_hotfix_express` constitution capability.

### 4. Parallel Phase Execution

Constitution-controlled parallel execution of `businessplan + techplan` within the techplan milestone. PRD must be committed first (dependency gate). All parallel phases must complete before milestone promotion.

### 5. Artifact Validation Hooks

Per-artifact structural validation at commit time. Checks required sections, word counts, cross-references. Three severities: FAIL, WARN, PASS. Constitution can override validators per domain.

### 6. Content-Aware Sensing

Sensing now compares actual artifact content (section-headers + content blocks), not just scope names. Similarity above 0.7 threshold triggers HIGH CONTENT OVERLAP. Reduces false positives from domain-level alerts.

### 7. /dashboard Command

New `/dashboard` (DB) command showing all active initiatives:
- Mermaid Gantt timeline grouped by domain/service
- Summary table: initiative, track, phase, milestone, blocking PRs, sensing alerts
- Stale PR warnings (>48h), ready-to-promote recommendations

### 8. Artifact Templates

Eight starter templates in `assets/templates/` that agents load as scaffolds:
- product-brief, prd, ux-design, architecture, epics, stories, implementation-readiness, sprint-status

### 9. Dev-Complete Milestone

Optional milestone tracking whether all planned stories are in terminal state and all epic branches are merged to develop in target repos.

### 10. Gate Collapsing (Schema)

Constitution-controlled gate collapsing to reduce PR chains for small features. Small features (≤3 stories): single PR. Medium features (≤8 stories): two PRs. Requires `collapse_gates` constitution capability.

### 6 New Constitution Capabilities

| Capability | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `permit_hotfix_express` | false | Allow hotfix-express track |
| `enable_parallel_phases` | false | Allow parallel phase execution |
| `collapse_gates` | false | Allow gate collapsing |
| `artifact_validator_overrides` | — | Override per-artifact validation |
| `template_overrides` | — | Override artifact templates per domain |
| `content_sensing_mode` | informational | Override content sensing severity |

## v3.1 → v3.2 — Express Track & Feature Mobility (Apr 1, 2026)

**Schema change: v3.1 → v3.2.** This release focuses on reducing ceremony for small work, adding post-initiative learning, and enabling feature mobility across organizational structures.

*Commits: `cc57679`, `917e890`*

### Express Track & /expressplan Command

New `express` track for small features, solo work, and quick turnaround:

| Aspect | Express Track |
|--------|--------------|
| **Command** | `/expressplan` |
| **Phases** | 1 (expressplan — combines all planning) |
| **Milestone Branches** | 0 (feature branch only) |
| **PRs** | 0 |
| **Steps** | 5 (preflight → plan → review → epics-stories → dev-ready) |
| **Gate Behavior** | Uses `collapse_gates` constitution capability |
| **Auto-advance** | devproposal → sprintplan collapsed |

The express track is ideal for features where the full ceremony of separate milestone branches and PR reviews is disproportionate to the work involved.

### /retrospective Command

New post-initiative review workflow (`/retrospective`, 4 steps):

1. **Gather** — Collect initiative artifacts, timeline, sensing alerts, PR history
2. **Analyze** — What worked well, what didn't, systemic patterns
3. **Report** — Generate structured retrospective artifact
4. **Actions** — Extract actionable improvements for future initiatives

Output: `retrospective.md` committed to the initiative folder.

### /log-problem Command

New utility workflow for recording issues and friction points during active initiatives. Creates structured problem entries with context (current phase, milestone, branch state) for retrospective review.

### /move-feature Command

Reclassify a feature initiative to a different domain/service. Updates:
- Branch names (if using DSF naming)
- `initiative-state.yaml` scope references
- `features.yaml` registry entry
- Governance inventory references

### /split-feature Command

Split a feature initiative into multiple child initiatives:
- Creates new initiative branches for each child
- Copies relevant artifacts (selectively)
- Updates parent initiative state to reference children
- Maintains sensing relationships between parent and children

### Feature-Only Branch Naming

Initiatives can now use short feature-only branch names (e.g., `auth` instead of `foo-bar-auth`) when the feature name is unique across the workspace.

**`features.yaml`** (control-repo root) maps feature names to their domain/service context:

```yaml
features:
  auth:
    domain: foo
    service: bar
    initiative_root: auth
```

Sensing resolves feature-only names via this registry. This reduces cognitive overhead and simplifies branch management.

### Gate Collapsing Implementation

The v3.1 gate collapsing schema is now fully implemented:
- `collapse_gates` constitution capability controls enablement
- Express track uses collapsed gates by default
- devproposal → sprintplan auto-advance when gates are collapsed
- Milestone-promotion step-02 reads constitution for collapsing rules

### Constitution Updates

New constitution capabilities for v3.2:
- `branching_strategy` — control DSF vs feature-only naming
- `stakeholder_gate` — fine-grained stakeholder review configuration
- `collapse_gates` — now fully implemented (schema introduced in v3.1)

### Sensing Enhancements

- `features.yaml` resolution for feature-only branch names
- Feature-only names resolved to full domain/service path during overlap detection

### Onboarding Documentation

Four new documentation files for first-time users:
- **GETTING-STARTED.md** — 3-step quick start, track selection guide, key commands
- **onboarding-checklist.md** — Step-by-step with troubleshooting
- **configuration-examples.md** — Sample configs for solo dev, teams, enterprise
- **index.md** — Updated documentation hub with quick reference table

### New Files Summary (v3.2)

| Category | Files Added |
|----------|-------------|
| Workflows | `router/expressplan/` (6 files), `router/retrospective/` (6 files), `utility/log-problem/` (3 files), `utility/move-feature/` (3 files), `utility/split-feature/` (3 files) |
| Prompts | 5 new: expressplan, retrospective, log-problem, move-feature, split-feature |
| Documentation | GETTING-STARTED.md, onboarding-checklist.md, configuration-examples.md |
| Skills Updated | constitution, git-orchestration, sensing |

## v3.2 → v3.2.1 — Quality & Documentation Hardening (Apr 1, 2026)

A comprehensive quality scan identified 379 issues (4 critical, 62 high, 293 medium, 20 low) across the module. This patch resolves all actionable findings across 6 remediation phases. No schema changes — fully backward compatible.

### Critical & High Fixes

- **Path convention enforcement** — `{project-root}` used for `_bmad/` paths; release module references now use `{release_repo_root}` variable (defined in `bmadconfig.yaml`, defaults to `lens.core`); `_bmad-output/` is workspace-relative
- **Bare `_bmad` references** — Fixed 20+ documentation references that omitted the required repo prefix (`lens.core/` or `bmad.lens.src/`)
- **Configurable release repo path** — Added `release_repo_root` to `bmadconfig.yaml`; all prompts, workflows, skills, and docs now reference `{release_repo_root}` instead of hardcoded `lens.core/`
- **Agent activation refactored** — Replaced defensive padding (caps, emoji, negation patterns) in `lens.agent.md` step 2 with direct outcome-focused language
- **Shell lint** — Fixed SC2034 (`export SKIP_CONSTITUTION` for cross-script consumption), SC2043 (shellcheck directive for intentional single-item loop), SC2168 (`local` outside function scope)

### Internationalization

- All 26 prompt files now include `communication_language` and `document_output_language` frontmatter variables, enabling non-English agent interaction

### Efficiency Improvements

- **Lifecycle caching** — Documented session cache convention for `lifecycle.yaml` reads
- **Parallel execution** — Independent reads in init-initiative step-03 can now run concurrently
- **Constitution caching** — Preflight Step 5 checks session cache before resolving
- **Check-dirty reorder** — Moved from step-04 to step-01 for earlier git state detection
- **Output contracts** — Added explicit `OUTPUT CONTRACT` sections to preflight steps
- **Batch initiative loading** — Status workflow step-03 uses `git-state.load-initiative-configs` for batch loading

### Clarity Improvements

- **Dev prompt consolidation** — 3 redundant write-scope warnings collapsed to single `WRITE-SCOPE INVARIANT` callout
- **Preflight strategy extraction** — Verbose pull strategy rationale moved to `docs/preflight-strategy.md`
- **Constitution substeps** — Deep 3-level nesting in preflight Step 5 refactored into linear substeps 5a–5d
- **Minor prompt improvements** — Enhanced discover, init-initiative, move-feature, sprintplan, expressplan, help, and lens.agent.md

### Documentation

- **Core workflow details** — `docs/architecture.md` now documents the 3 core workflows (phase-lifecycle, audience-promotion, milestone-promotion) with trigger and purpose
- **Branching strategy reference** — `docs/configuration-examples.md` now includes a branching strategy comparison table (trunk-based, pr-per-milestone, pr-per-epic)
- **Help/bmad-help distinction** — help SKILL.md now clarifies that `/help` is LENS-specific while `/bmad-help` is a cross-module meta-command
- **Governance-aware discover** — discover workflow.md documents that Step 4 accesses the governance repo via sibling clone
- **Prompt naming guide** — New `prompts/README.md` documents the `lens-work.{command}.prompt.md` naming convention and menu trigger mapping
- **Skill archetypes** — README.md documents internal delegation vs workflow skill patterns with CIS/TEA dependency descriptions
- **Deferred items backlog** — TODO.md updated with new workflows, script extraction candidates, and enhancement roadmap

### Script Extraction

Nine new paired `.sh` + `.ps1` scripts extracted from workflow markdown into standalone executables:

| Script | Source Workflow | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `scan-active-initiatives` | status/step-03 | Scan initiative-state.yaml files, output table/json/csv |
| `load-command-registry` | help | Parse module-help.csv, group by category, fuzzy matching |
| `derive-initiative-status` | status/step-03-derive-state | Derive milestone/phase/PR state per initiative |
| `validate-phase-artifacts` | core/phase-lifecycle/step-02 | Check required artifacts per phase from lifecycle.yaml |
| `plan-lifecycle-renames` | upgrade/step-02 | Scan v2 audience branches, build rename plan to v3 milestones |
| `validate-feature-move` | move-feature/step-01 | Validate move target, check conflicts, verify scope |
| `bootstrap-target-projects` | onboard/step-03 | Clone/verify repos from governance repo-inventory.yaml |
| `derive-next-action` | next/step-02 | Apply lifecycle decision rules, return next command or gate |
| `run-preflight-cached` | preflight | Timestamp-cached wrapper around preflight.sh (TTL-based) |

### New Workflows

Five new workflow directories with full step-driven architecture, SKILL.md, and prompt files:

| Command | Menu Code | Category | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| `/approval-status` | AS | Utility | Show pending promotion PR approval state and review status |
| `/rollback-phase` | RB | Utility | Safely revert to previous milestone while preserving git history |
| `/pause-epic` | PE | Utility | Suspend in-flight epic state to initiative-state.yaml |
| `/resume-epic` | RE | Utility | Resume paused epic with re-sensing and validation |
| `/audit-all-initiatives` | AA | Governance | Aggregate compliance dashboard across all active initiatives |
| `/profile` | PF | Utility | View and edit onboarding profile settings |

### UX & Safety Enhancements

**First-Run Experience:**
- Pre-init scope explainer in `/new-initiative` — detects empty/ambiguous scope, shows domain/service/feature explanation with examples
- Config load failure diagnosis — missing fields enumerated with `/onboard` link
- LENS_VERSION mismatch — shows both versions (control repo vs release module) with `/lens-upgrade` link

**Governance Improvements:**
- Sensing soft gate — high-severity overlaps (same feature name in same service) pause with proceed/rename/abort options
- Constitution-aware track filtering — `/new-initiative` filters tracks by governance; blocked tracks marked ⛔
- Sensing advisory guidance — per-overlap action recommendations (rename, merge, adjust scope, review)

**Lifecycle Improvements:**
- `/next` preview — shows recommended action and waits for confirmation before auto-executing
- Status health indicators — stuck detection (PR open >7 days), completeness badges (phases complete: 3/5)
- Pre-sprintplan readiness summary — epic/story completeness scan warns if >20% stories are missing

**Safety Improvements:**
- Move-feature in-flight work safeguards — detects active branches, open PRs that would be orphaned
- Branch-state validation before constitution load — preflight warns of branch mismatch, offers switch
- Governance repo requirements documented in architecture.md §12

### Architecture & Integration

**Batch PR Status Queries:**
- Status workflow step-03 now collects all `{head, base}` tuples across initiatives before querying
- Single `git-orchestration.batch-query-pr-status` call replaces N sequential PR queries (previously 5 initiatives × 4 phases = 20 calls)

**Parallel Sensing + Constitution:**
- Init-initiative step-03 restructured to use `invoke_async` for concurrent sensing and constitution resolution
- Both operations are read-only and independent — parallel execution reduces latency

**Context Propagation:**
- Preflight now publishes `session.preflight_result` with `{remote_url, provider, auth_status, sync_status, timestamp}`
- Downstream workflows reference session context instead of re-deriving provider and remote info
- Formal OUTPUT CONTRACT section added to preflight.md documenting all guaranteed session variables

### New & Modified Files (v3.2.1)

| Category | Changes |
|----------|--------|
| Prompts | All 26 updated (i18n headers); `prompts/README.md` added; 6 new prompt files for new workflows |
| Workflows | 20+ updated (preflight, init-initiative, expressplan, sprintplan, discover, help, status, dashboard, move-feature, next, cross-initiative + step files); 5 router workflows updated (`inputs: []`); 6 new workflow directories (approval-status, rollback-phase, pause-epic, resume-epic, audit-all, profile) |
| Documentation | 8 updated (architecture §12 governance requirements, configuration-examples, GETTING-STARTED, onboarding-checklist, pipeline-source-to-release, copilot-repo-instructions, README); 1 added (preflight-strategy.md) |
| Agents | lens.agent.md, lens.agent.yaml updated (7 new menu items: AS, RB, PE, RE, AA, PF + config diagnostics) |
| Scripts | preflight.sh, promote-branch.sh fixed; 18 new scripts (9 `.sh` + 9 `.ps1` pairs) |
| Meta | TODO.md updated — all enhancement roadmap items tracked; module-help.csv updated (6 new entries) |

## Migration Guide

### v2.x → v3.0 (Breaking)

1. Run `/lens-upgrade` — migrates lifecycle.yaml schema v2 → v3
2. Existing initiatives get `initiative-state.yaml` files created automatically
3. Audience branches (`{root}-small`, `{root}-medium`, etc.) are no longer used
4. New milestone branches will be created as you progress through phases

### v3.0 → v3.1 (Non-breaking)

1. Update module version — `schema_version: 3` → `schema_version: 3.1`
2. All new features are additive and disabled-by-default
3. Enable opt-in features via constitution capabilities as needed
4. `/dashboard` available immediately with no configuration

### v3.1 → v3.2 (Non-breaking)

1. Update module version — `schema_version: 3.1` → `schema_version: 3.2`
2. New commands available immediately: `/expressplan`, `/retrospective`, `/log-problem`, `/move-feature`, `/split-feature`
3. Feature-only naming: create `features.yaml` at control-repo root when ready
4. Gate collapsing now fully functional — enable via `collapse_gates` constitution capability

### v3.2 → v3.2.1 (Non-breaking)

No migration needed. All changes are additive documentation, i18n headers, and internal quality fixes. Prompt frontmatter additions (`communication_language`, `document_output_language`) are ignored if not configured in `bmadconfig.yaml`.
