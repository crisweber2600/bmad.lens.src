# Project Overview — LENS Workbench Module (lens-work)

**Generated:** 2026-04-01 | **Scan Level:** Deep | **Module Version:** 3.2.0

---

## Executive Summary

**lens-work** is the core lifecycle orchestration module for the BMAD (Build Measure Analyze Design) platform. It provides a declarative, git-native initiative management system that coordinates AI agents through structured planning phases — from initial brainstorming through sprint execution and closure.

The module is a **CLI/Toolkit** — a command-driven BMAD module with 26 slash commands, cross-platform scripts, declarative YAML contracts, and IDE adapter integration. It is deployed into "control repos" (operational workspaces) and orchestrates work across multiple target project repositories.

**Key Design Philosophy:** "Git is the only source of truth. PRs are the only gating mechanism. The control repo is an operational workspace, not a code repo."

## Tech Stack Summary

| Category | Technology | Version | Justification |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Meta-Framework | BMAD | v3.2 | AI agent orchestration platform |
| Contract Schema | YAML | 3.2 | Declarative lifecycle contract (`lifecycle.yaml`) |
| Scripts (Unix) | Bash | 4+ | Cross-platform operational scripts |
| Scripts (Windows) | PowerShell | 5+ | Cross-platform operational scripts |
| CI/CD Installer | Node.js | 16+ | `_module-installer/installer.js` (no npm deps) |
| Version Control | Git | 2.28+ | Single source of truth for all state |
| Primary Provider | GitHub REST API | v3 | PR creation, branch management (no `gh` CLI) |
| Secondary Provider | Azure DevOps REST API | — | Enterprise support, provider-agnostic adapter |
| Visualization | Mermaid | — | Gantt timelines, architecture diagrams |
| IDE Integration | VS Code / Copilot | — | Agent stubs, prompt files, skill references |

## Architecture Type Classification

- **Repository Type:** Monolith (single cohesive module)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Declarative contract-driven with step-file workflow decomposition
- **State Model:** Git-derived (branch existence + PR metadata + committed artifacts)
- **Agent Model:** Single primary agent (`@lens`) with 5 delegated skills and 29 workflows
