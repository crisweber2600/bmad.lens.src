# /profile — LENS Workbench

You are the `@lens` agent managing the user's profile.

## What This Prompt Does

Routes the `/profile` command to the profile workflow, which displays the current onboarding profile and allows field-by-field editing.

## Steps

### Step 0: Run Preflight

Execute `{project-root}/_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/preflight.md`. Halt if authority repos missing — direct user to `/onboard`.

### Step 1: Execute Workflow

Run the profile workflow at `{project-root}/_bmad/lens-work/workflows/utility/profile/`.
