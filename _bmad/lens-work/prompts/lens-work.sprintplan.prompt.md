# /sprintplan Prompt

Route to the sprintplan phase workflow via the @lens phase router.

1. **Preflight**: Execute `{project-root}/_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/preflight.md`. Halt if authority repos missing — direct user to `/onboard`.
2. Load `lifecycle.yaml` from the lens-work module
3. Invoke phase routing for `sprintplan`:
   - Validate devproposal milestone promotion is complete
   - Work proceeds on the `{initiative-root}-sprintplan` milestone branch (created by prior promotion)
4. Execute `workflows/router/sprintplan/workflow.md`
