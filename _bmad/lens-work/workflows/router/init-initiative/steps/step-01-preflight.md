# Step 1: Preflight And Scope Initialization

**Goal:** Confirm the environment is ready, determine which creation command the user invoked, and initialize the shared state for the rest of the workflow.

---

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### 1. Shared Preflight And Scope Detection

```yaml
invoke: include
path: "{preflightInclude}"
params:
  skip_constitution: true

command_name = inputs.command_name

if command_name == "/new-domain":
  scope = "domain"
else if command_name == "/new-service":
  scope = "service"
else if command_name == "/new-feature":
  scope = "feature"
else:
  FAIL("❌ Unsupported command for init-initiative: ${command_name}")

lifecycle = load("{lifecycleContract}")
module_config = load("{moduleConfigPath}")
profile = load_if_exists("{personal_output_folder}/profile.yaml")
current_context = invoke: git-state.current-initiative
```

### 2. Early Dirty-State Check

Fail immediately if uncommitted work would interfere with branch creation in later steps.

```yaml
dirty_state = invoke: git-orchestration.check-dirty

if dirty_state.status == "dirty":
  output: |
    ❌ Working tree is not clean.
    ├── Files changed: ${dirty_state.files_changed || 0}
    └── Files: ${(dirty_state.files || []).join(', ')}

    Commit or stash the pending work, then rerun the initiative creation command.
  FAIL("❌ Initiative creation stopped to avoid mixing uncommitted work with new branch setup.")

output: |
  🌱 Initiative creation initialized
  ├── Command: ${command_name}
  └── Scope: ${scope}
```
