# Workflow Plan: dev

## Goal

Implement every story in a selected epic inside the TargetProject repo, run constitutional and review gates per story, then close the epic through the initiative branch.

## Step Structure

1. `steps/step-01-preflight.md`
   - Resolve initiative context
   - Resolve and validate the target repo
   - Ensure large-to-base promotion is complete
   - Inject constitutional context and branch assertions
2. `steps/step-02-story-discovery.md`
   - Handle batch-mode question runs
   - Discover ordered story files for the epic
   - Confirm execution scope with the user
3. `steps/step-03-story-loop.md`
   - Loop through each story
   - Enforce story-level gates
   - Route branch setup and write guards
   - Surface implementation guidance and run the review/PR loop
4. `steps/step-04-epic-completion.md`
   - Run epic-level adversarial and party-mode checks
   - Create epic PR into the initiative branch
   - Wait at the hard merge gate
5. `steps/step-05-closeout.md`
   - Offer retrospective
   - Update state and event log
   - Complete the initiative when all phases are done
