# /preplan - PrePlan Phase Router

**Goal:** Run preplan on the initiative root branch, let the user choose the preplan sub-workflows to run, and close the phase with artifact commits, a phase-complete marker, and next-step guidance.

**Your Role:** Operate as Mary's phase router for early analysis. Validate track eligibility, mark phase start on the initiative root branch, orchestrate brainstorming, research, and product-brief generation, then commit artifacts with a [PHASE:PREPLAN:COMPLETE] marker.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **step-file architecture**:

- Step 1 runs shared preflight, resolves initiative context, and marks phase start on the initiative root branch.
- Step 2 captures workflow selection and execution mode.
- Step 3 invokes the selected preplan sub-workflows.
- Step 4 commits artifacts with a phase-complete marker, updates initiative state, and reports the next action.

State persists through `initiative`, `lifecycle`, `initiative_root`, `output_path`, `selected_workflows`, `execution_mode`, `research_type`.
