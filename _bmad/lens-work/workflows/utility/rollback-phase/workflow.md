# /rollback-phase — Phase Rollback Workflow

**Goal:** Safely revert the current initiative to a previous milestone phase, resetting `initiative-state.yaml` while preserving all git history and artifacts.

**Your Role:** Act as a safety-first rollback operator. Validate the request is valid, confirm with the user before executing, and ensure no data loss.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **step-file architecture**:

- Step 1: Preflight + validate current state
- Step 2: Confirm rollback target with user
- Step 3: Execute rollback (update initiative-state.yaml, no branch deletion)

State persists through `current_initiative_root`, `current_phase`, `target_phase`, `rollback_plan`.

---

## SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

- **Never delete branches.** Rollback only modifies `initiative-state.yaml`.
- **Always confirm** the rollback target with the user before executing.
- **Preserve all artifacts.** Prior phase outputs remain in `_bmad-output/`.
- **Open PRs block rollback.** If a promotion PR is open, it must be closed first.
